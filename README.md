# ap_physics_c_physics_ball
A gravity-related project I did during the summer of 2024 for my AP Physics C class.

# Details
- This project was created using the Processing library. 
- The aim of this project was to simulate the effects of earth-like gravity on a set of balls dropped from different heights. 
- Using this data as well as real-world data I gathered, I was able to experimentally calculate "g" for my AP Physics C class

# How to run
This project was not explicitly made to be run, as I sort of bodged this together within a relatively short timeframe to meet the demands of the summer assignment. However, if you do for whatever reason want to run this project, use the Processing IDE.
